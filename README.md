Cockatiel Color Palette

The Cockatiel Color Palette features pictures and descriptions of each North American color variety, a short refresher course in genetics, as well as the Virtual Breeder — enter the parent birds’ types, and it will calculate all the offspring types (including combinations and splits) that could result from that pairing. Only a subset of the code is posted here (and no image assets).
